\section{Overview}

\textbf{Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item EEG time series data
    \item \textbf{asynchronous}:\\
        ``subject does not follow any fixed scheme but concentrates repetitively on a mental task for a random amount of time
        and switches directly to the next, without passing through a rest state''
    \item preprocessing was done to also be able to use weka
    \item exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the data\ldots
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Classification}\\
Different classification methods were used: explicit time series models (HMM, NN?, \ldots) and others that ignore fact that data is a time series (SVM, \ldots).

\textbf{Training Data}\\
Mostly the precomputed PSD data was used for classification.
\arr because it reduces data\\
\arr because it ``summarizes'' the data, also in a sense encodes some time information?
\arr \ldots
